<p class="text2">
    I am naturally confident and driven candidate looking to build a career in software development and quality
    assurance.
    In my work as a senior advisor at the OU I advocate for the customer when they encounter pain points and define
    issues to business stakeholders. I hope to expand these skills and begin a career in tech.
    I am currently studying for a degree in computer technology in my own time. I also actively seek out experience in
    software development. I have joined in scrum rituals with the dev team at the OU and worked closely with their QA.
    I have a positive, outgoing, proactive personality and welcome a challenge. I am Self-motivated and enjoy working
    within a team. I am always open to opportunities to improve my career and skills. I have a true passion for software
    development and have a wide experience using Microsoft and other proprietary software.
